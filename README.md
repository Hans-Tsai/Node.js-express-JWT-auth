# Introduction
- This is my self practice of the **Node.js Auth Tutorial** on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) which is owned by The Net Ninja.
- In these tutorials, we'll learn about how to authenticate users on the website with JSON Web Token(= `JWT`). 
- And at the end of these tutorials, we'll also create a **Ninja Smoothies** website with two features. Here we go!
  + `Register`
  + `Log In/Log out`
